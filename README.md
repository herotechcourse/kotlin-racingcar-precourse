### Future consideration
Although the current feature list is intentionally kept simple and high-level to maintain clarity and focus during the initial phase, the structure allows for a more granular breakdown if the project evolves. Here's an example of how the existing features can be extended into sub-features in future iterations:

- input: User input for car names and race rounds
    - errorHandling: Error handling for invalid input
- car: Car class with name and position
    - validation: Validation of car names
    - positionUpdates: updating the position of a car
    - displayProgress: display progress of a car
- race: Race class with race logic and progress tracking
    - simulation: Race simulation logic
    - displayCarsProgress: Display race progress after each round
    - displayWinners: Determine and display race winners

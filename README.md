# kotlin-racingcar-precourse

## Planned Features

1. Ask the user to enter car names (comma-separated) and how many rounds to play.
2. Validate the input: car names should not be empty or longer than 5 characters, and the number of rounds must be a valid number.
3. Create Car and RacingGame classes. The Car moves based on a random number, and RacingGame handles running the game over multiple rounds.
4. Print how far each car has moved after each round using `-` to represent movement.
5. At the end of the race, figure out which car went the farthest and print them as the winners.
6. Write unit tests to check if car movement and winner logic works correctly.
7. Later, update this README with how to run the game and show an example of what the input/output looks like.

# Kotlin Racing Car Project

## Features to Implement

### 1. Input Handling and Validation
- Read car names as comma-separated input
- Validate that each car name is non-empty and doesn't exceed 5 characters
- Implement error handling for invalid car names (throw IllegalArgumentException)
- Read and validate the number of rounds for the race

### 2. Domain Model
- Create a Car class to represent racing cars
    - Store car name
    - Track car position
    - Implement movement logic based on random number generation
- Create a Race class to manage the race
    - Store collection of cars
    - Track current round
    - Execute rounds
    - Determine winners

### 3. Game Logic
- Implement random movement algorithm (move forward if random number ≥ 4)
- Track car positions throughout the race
- Execute the specified number of rounds
- Determine winner(s) after all rounds are complete

### 4. Output Formatting
- Display race results after each round
- Format car progress using dashes to represent position
- Display the final winner(s)
- Handle multiple winners with comma-separated output

### 5. Testing
- Unit tests for car movement logic
- Unit tests for winner determination
- Tests for input validation
- Integration tests for the complete race workflow

## Implementation Approach

I will follow these principles in my implementation:
- Keep functions small and focused, each one doing only one thing
- Limit nesting depth to a maximum of 2 levels
- Use proper exception handling for invalid inputs
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Make small, feature-focused commits following AngularJS commit message conventions
- Write comprehensive tests with JUnit 5 and AssertJ

## Development Plan
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Implement input handling and validation
3. Create the domain model classes
4. Implement the core game logic
5. Add output formatting
6. Write tests for all components
7. Refactor as needed to improve code quality

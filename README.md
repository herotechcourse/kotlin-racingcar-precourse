# kotlin-racingcar-precourse
## Planned features!

- [ ] Let users input car names (comma-separated)
- [ ] Validate that input isn't empty or weird ( 5 chars max per name, or empty), if it is throw an IllegalArgumentException and terminate.
- [ ] Ask how many rounds to run
- [ ] For each round, randomly decide if each car moves (4–9 = move)
- [ ] If a car moves, show it with a `-` next to its name
- [ ] Show the race progress after each round
- [ ] At the end, show the winner(s) — can be more than one


### Post testing and formatting
- [ ] Stick to the Kotlin style rules (2 levels of indent max, etc.)
- [ ] Write tests with JUnit 5 + AssertJ to check everything works

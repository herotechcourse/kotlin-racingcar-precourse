## ðŸ§¾ Rules

1. **Input**:
    - Car names: comma-separated, each â‰¤ 5 characters
    - Number of rounds: positive integer

2. **Race Logic**:
    - For each round, every car randomly generates a number from 0 to 9 using:

      ```kotlin
      Randoms.pickNumberInRange(0, 9)
      ```

    - If the number is **4 or higher**, the car moves forward by 1 unit.
    - Progress is visualized using `-` characters.
    - The race continues for the specified number of rounds.

3. **Result**:
    - Car(s) with the **furthest distance** are declared winner(s).
    - Multiple winners are shown if they share the max distance.

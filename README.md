# kotlin-racingcar-precourse


## Overview

This program simulates a car race where one or more cars win the race based on their random progress. The goal is to create a simple car race simulator that allows users to:
- Select the input the names of the cars (up to 5 characters each).
- Set the number of rounds for the race.
- Simulate each round with a 60% chance of a car advancing.
- Track which car advances the most and declare one or more winners at the end of the race.

## Planned Functions and Features

### 1. **Car Creation and Setup**
   - **Goal**: Enable user input for car names and number of rounds.
   - **Function to Implement**:
     - `createCars(String carNames)`: This function will take a single string containing car names, split the names, and create `Car` objects for each name. Each `Car` object will store an integer that tracks how many times the car has advanced during the race.
   - **Reasoning**: The user will enter car names in a single string (with commas separating each name). This function will handle extracting the car names, creating `Car` objects, and storing them in an array or list. The function will also initialize each carâ€™s progress counter to zero, allowing the program to track how many rounds each car advances.

### 2. **Race Implementation**
   - **Goal**: Implement functions to advance the cars each round with a random chance
   - **Function to Implement**:
     - `Car() { move() }`: This function with move the car with a random chance and update the progress.
     - `Car() { getProgress() }`: This function with move the car with a random chance
   - **Reasoning**: The created cars will participate in a race with a random chance. Implementing the progress functions within the class helps the code to be more concise and reduce boiler plate codes in the main function.

### 3. **Simulate Race and Result**
   - **Goal**: Implement the race and show the race progress as well as result
   - **Function to Implement**:
     - `simulateRace(Cars: List<Car>, rounds: Int)`: This function proceeds with the rounds and prints the process of the race.
     - `determineWinners(cars: List<Car>): List<Car>`: This function determines the winner of the race and returns it as a List 
   - **Reasoning**: The user needs to see the progress of each rounds and they are represented with a '-' character. At the end of the race, the winner is printed out.

### 4. **Error Handling**
   - **Goal**: Throw error when user enters invalid input
   - **Function to Implement**:
     - IllegalArgumentException when at invalid input
   - **Reasoning**: Input validation ensures the program behaves predictably and prevents unexpected crashes. Throwing IllegalArgumentException helps notify the user early when inputs like empty names, overly long names, or non-numeric rounds are entered.

### 5. **Refactoring**
   - **Goal**: Refactor used Classes and function within the program
   - **Reasoning**: Good code often means good readability. In order to increase readability of the code, separating some functions and classes can be a good idea. Trying to reduce too much raw code in main function can also be helpful.

### 6. **Add Test Cases**
   - **Goal**: Add different test cases to ensure functionality of the app and implement more Error handling if needed
   - **Test Cases to Implement**: 
      - Multiple winners
      - No winner
      - One player
      - Invalid Car names: regex("^[A-Za-z_]{1,5}$")
         - white space
         - too long names
         - empty input
         - duplicate names
      - Invalid Round number
         - zero or negative
   - **Reasoning**: Comprehensive test cases help ensure the program behaves correctly under various scenarios and edge cases. They also allow early detection of bugs and improve the reliability of the application.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Reflection

Through the development of this program, I gained valuable experience in various aspects of software development beyond simply writing code that works. This project challenged me to focus on writing **clean, maintainable code** and to consider how test cases can reflect **real user scenarios** and behaviors.

One of the most eye-opening parts of this experience was **working primarily through test files** rather than relying on the `main()` function. This approach required me to **think ahead**, design the program structure first, and then implement the logic to match those test cases. It significantly shifted my perspective on program design and highlighted the importance of **test-driven development**.

In addition, spending effort on writing **clear Git commit messages** and maintaining an updated **README file** helped me understand the value of good documentation and project history. Setting up **automated changelogs** was also a new but fascinating experience.

Learning the **Kotlin language** was equally rewarding. I enjoyed discovering its rich set of iteration functions and how object-oriented programming in Kotlin can be both **readable and concise**.

Lastly, I invested a great deal of time in laying a **solid foundation** before writing any code. While this process took time, Iâ€™m confident that these habits will become more efficient with practice. I'm excited to continue improving and see how these efforts pay off in future projects.

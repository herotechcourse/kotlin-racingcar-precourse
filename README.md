## Overview
This project is my implementation of the **Car Racing** game proposed by Delivery Hero's Tech Course, specifically for
the pre-work missions.

## List of features
Here you can find the list of features proposed for implementation. This list may change over time while iterating 
during the mission.

- Display an input for the user to send the list of cars.
- Create a function that stores the list of car names input by the user.
- Create a validation function that checks if the car names are no longer than **five** characters and separated by a
comma.
- Use the `Randoms` API to assign a random advance to each car per round.
- Create a car advancement function that stores the accumulated advance per round per car.
- Create a function that displays the advancement per car including the car name and how much it moved (if any).
- Create a compare function to see which car won.
- Create a function that displays the winner name. In the case of more than one winner, display the car names 
separated by commas.

## Features to implement
- function to accept list of car names (car names must be separated by a comma and should not be longer than 5 characters).
- function to accept number of rounds.
- Each of the n cars can either move forward or stay still during a given number of rounds.
- A car moves forward if a randomly generated number between 0 and 9 is 4 or greater.
- When printing the progress of each car, display the car's name alongside its movement.
- After the race is complete, display the winners. There can be multiple winners if they reach the same final position.

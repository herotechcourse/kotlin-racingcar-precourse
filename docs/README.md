## ðŸš— Racing Car Game

### ðŸ§± Project Structure

This project follows a layered structure to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

```
â””â”€â”€ racingcar
    â”œâ”€â”€ Application.kt          // Entry point of the program
    â”œâ”€â”€ domain
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Car.kt              // Represents a car and its movement logic
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Cars.kt             // Manages a collection of cars and determines winners
    â”œâ”€â”€ view
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ InputView.kt        // Handles user input
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ResultView.kt       // Displays game results
    â”œâ”€â”€ controller
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ RacingGame.kt       // Manages game rounds and progression
    â””â”€â”€ util
        â”œâ”€â”€ InputValidator.kt   // Validate Inputs
        â””â”€â”€ RandomGenerator.kt  // Generates random numbers (used for car movement)
```

### ðŸ§ª Test Structure

```
â””â”€â”€ test
    â””â”€â”€ racingcar
        â”œâ”€â”€ ApplicationTest.kt      // Default Test code
        â”œâ”€â”€ domain
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CarTest.kt          // Unit tests for Car movement logic
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CarsTest.kt         // Unit tests for Cars winner logic
        â””â”€â”€ controller
            â””â”€â”€ RacingGameTest.kt   // Tests full round progression and game flow
        
```


### âœ… Feature Requirements

- [x] **Receive car names and number of rounds from the user**
    - [x] Prompt the user to input car names separated by commas (`,`).
    - [x] Prompt the user to input the number of racing rounds.
    - [x] If the input is invalid, throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

- [x] **Handle car movement logic**
    - [x] For each round, generate a random number between 0 and 9 for each car.
    - [x] If the number is 4 or higher, the car moves forward by one space.
    - [x] If the number is less than 4, the car does not move.

- [x] **Display race status for each round**
    - [x] After each round, print the current status of all cars.
    - [x] Each carâ€™s movement should be displayed using `-` symbols (e.g., `pobbi : ---`).

- [x] **Determine and print the winner(s)**
    - [x] After all rounds, determine which car(s) moved the farthest.
    - [x] If there are multiple winners, print all their names separated by commas.

- [x] **Validate user input**
    - [x] Throw an exception if any car name is empty or contains only whitespace.
    - [x] Throw an exception if a car name exceeds the allowed length.
    - [x] Throw an exception if the number of rounds is not a valid positive integer.

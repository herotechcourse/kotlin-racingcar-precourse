# List of Features

## 🏎 Game flow
1. Start the program.
2. Request user inputs (2ea)
3. Validate the inputs.
4. Execute the race.
5. Print out the result of each round and final winner(s).


    [game-start]                : request & validate input. 
        ↓
    [game-init]                 : split carNames, trim, create Car objects, parse nRounds.
        ↓
    [RaceExecution]             : move cars per round using random value >= 4.
        ↓
    [GameLoop / GameFlowManager]: repeat race-execution as many as nRounds, store each round states. 
        ↓
    [ProgressTracking]          : track car positions per round, store each progress
        ↓
    [GameEnd / Winners]         : check winners based on final position (! multiple winners)
        ↓
    [Output]                    : print round by round state and final result

## 🏌️ Approach
    Break down the Game flow into small,
    testable feature modules like below.

## 🗒 Memo
### 1. Input
- Names of the cars, comma-separated, entered by the user <br>
        ex) `pobi,woni,jun` <br>

- The number of rounds<br>
        ex) `5`

### 2. Output
- Race results by round <br>
    ex) <br>
    `pobi : --`  
    `woni : ----`  
    `jun  : ---`

- Message for a single winner <br>
    ex) `Winners : pobi`
    
- Message for multiple winners <br>
    ex) `Winners : pobi, jun`

### 3. To be organized
- Each of the n cars can either move forward or stay still during a given number of rounds.

- A car moves forward if a randomly generated number between 0 and 9 is 4 or greater.

- When printing the progress of each car, display the car's name alongside its movement.

- After the race is complete, display the winners. There can be multiple winners if they reach the same final position. <br>
    - If there are multiple winners, their names should be displayed and separated by commas.

- If the user inputs invalid data, the program should throw an IllegalArgumentException and terminate.
